Yet in the aftermath of the 2008 financial meltdown, amidst growing income inequality, political disillusionment and class disparity, the appeal of the Nordic model - the economic and social policies common to Denmark, Norway, Finland, Iceland and Sweden - continues to be held up as the ideal welfare state around the world.<br><br>While the Nordic countries continue to have relatively high income equality, robust welfare programs, powerful unions and relatively low unemployment rates - up close, the Nordic model is far from a consistent set of practices. Growing political disillusionment has seen the rapid rise of radical populist parties, while labor reform and austerity measures have significantly undermined the pact of the welfare state to protect the well being of its individual citizens. Aside from existing in a certain geographical and cultural context, one could ask, is there a Nordic model?<br><br>In Finland, with the wounded post-Nokia economy struggling to find a new balance in a mutating market, a rapidly aging demographic is tipping the dependency ratio into debt. Governmental politics has reacted - like the rest of the world - by a shift towards the neoliberal. The neoliberal turn, described by Michel Foucault as a fundamental shift to “govern <mark>for</mark> the market rather than because of the market,” has led to a conflicting set of values and practices. Welfare initiatives today seem more concerned with improving market competitiveness and the smooth flow of capital than the well being of its citizens. Indeed, recent reforms all point towards an ideological project to dismantle the autonomy of the infrastructure, instruments and processes of the welfare state. Demands for instilling competitive economic behaviour affects all public services and policies, from infrastructure to healthcare, to education, and even governance itself. At what point do these demands come to odds with protecting the equality of opportunity, equality of wealth and public responsibility that have for so long defined Nordic society?<br><br>Nowhere are these conflicting values more apparent than in the rhetoric that surrounds Nordic architecture, urbanism and design. The new buzzwords: Innovative, Smart, Sustainable, Attractive, Functional - terms that when critically considered are aimed more at facilitating the flow of business, than the individual autonomy of citizens. In the guise of delivering better and more efficient services, what we see are a set of priorities that consolidate wealth and power in the hands of international corporations and public bureaucracy. Unchecked, innovation becomes consumption, smart becomes surveillance, sustainable becomes reactionary, attractive becomes fashionable and functional becomes the standardized. Even attempts to appeal to citizen participation and involvement through the spectacle of urban events has replaced the values of democracy with a virulent populism.<br><br>Today, as the profession of architecture appears ever more complicit to the interests of development and neoliberal politics, what we face is not simply a growing powerlessness, but a crisis of imagination. Informed by <mark>The Twenties</mark> - the Autumn 2015 research seminar investigating Helsinki housing blocks from the 1920’s, this course - <mark>Nordic Model</mark>, continues in the belief that architecture is not merely a part of the built environment, but a means of producing a world we can aspire to. For the architects of the 1920’s, tasked with the project of nation building for a newly independent Finland, architecture was projective - actively proposing and enabling new ways of living together in the emerging condition of modern urban society.<br><br>As we approach the next twenties, architecture cannot stand by and provide “solutions” to the status quo. Confined to an architectural discourse that can't seem to move beyond providing "better services", "connection with nature" and a "high quality built environment", the need for a critical reappraisal of architecture in the Nordic context is more important than ever. Though the Nordic model may not be cogent, it is above all an opportunity to project and imagine a synthesis of urban form and collective values. There may be no clear Nordic model, but there can be Nordic <mark>models</mark>.<br><br>Course teachers: Leonard Ma, Tuomas Toivonen<br><br>Studio participants: Petter Eklund, Mari Synnøve Gjertsen, Tuuli Kanerva, Thomas Laine, Leo Lindroos, Henna Miettinen, Amund Mikaelsen Rolfsen, Antti Soini</p></div></section></div><footer><h4 class="home-link"><a href="../index.html">HOME</a></h4></footer><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
