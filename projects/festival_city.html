The big pen writes on. The great narrative unfolds itself on the page. Amidst the story, the little people are getting lost. The story has no name, no beginning and no end. The thematic complexities are seemingly endless. What could my role be within all of this? We need art more than ever. Art helps us to understand what is going on.”</mark><br><br>Erik Söderblom - Director’s Statement, Helsinki Juhlaviikot 2014<br><br><br>Festival City is a hypothesis for an event architecture. Through the simple act of framing, Festival city offers the possibility for a space that can be freely interpreted by its participants in a moment of collective endeavour. As such, the event of the architecture is not through the whimsy of ephemeral programme, but the backdrop against which these events can occur. The architecture of Festival City becomes not only a limit to the forces of the city, but legitimizes and makes visible the collective ideals of the space contained within.<br><br>Festival City is a proposal for the heart of Helsinki Juhlaviikot. As the largest arts festival in the Nordics, Helsinki Festival attracts over 200,000 visitors every year in a yearly two week celebration dedicated to arts and music. The event is on a basic level, talkoot, a collective action of a community to contribute to a common purpose. The processes of the event are already imbued with a firm set of collective values and though by no means an informal organization, is truly an expression from the “bottom-up”.<br><br>Located in Kansalaistori (Citizens Square) in Helsinki, Finland, Festival City is the epicentre for festival events occurring all across Helsinki. Over the course of the two week festival, a wide variety of programmes occur, creating a constantly changing landscape of art events in the park. Documented in the form of a space-time-masterplan, Festival City presents these events as tangible locations occupying specific times, creating a hypothetical city-within a city that the participants are invited to help build. Within the condensed space of Festival City, activities such as opening a picnic blanket or playing guitar, take on a new significance. The project makes visible how even our seemingly small contributions can have an impact on the space of the city, and are on a most fundamental level the true essence of the city<br><br>The proposal establishes a perimeter, not a perimeter as a barrier, but a perimeter of thresholds. Consisting of 130 monolithic blocks, Festival City delineates a perimeter then pivots the individual blocks to create a multitude of openings with depth, opened doors. The gesture simultaneously separates and welcomes, creating a limit that intensifies the experience of the festival events within.</p><p class="project-img"><img src="/images/festival_city/festival_city1.jpg" alt="axo-image" width="400"></p><p class="project-img"><img src="/images/festival_city/festival_city2.jpg" alt="axo-image" width="400"></p><p class="project-img"><img src="/images/festival_city/festival_city3.jpg" alt="axo-image" width="400"></p><p class="project-img"><img src="/images/festival_city/festival_city_photo.jpg" alt="axo-image" width="400"></p><p></p></div></section></div><footer><h4 class="home-link"><a href="../index.html">HOME</a></h4></footer><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
