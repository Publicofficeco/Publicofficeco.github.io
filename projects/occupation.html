Nearly 1.5 million square meters of new construction, 25,000 new residents and perhaps most exceptionally - 10,000 new jobs. This decision signals an ambitious and forward thinking shift, Hiedanranta will not simply be a sleepy residential suburb of Tampere, but a vibrant and fourishing district in its own right. With the proposed Tampere tram line, Hiedanranta has the potential to become a densely urban and connected working environment. While the picturesque lake front, historical buildings and green recreational areas offer an opportunity for Hiedanranta to become a place to have a home.<br><br>The anticipated growth of Tampere is part of a global pattern of migration towards urban centres. The densely populated urban centre is attractive because of the availability of services and opportunity that it offers. It becomes of great importance not only to accommodate new residents, but also to foster the intensity and opportunity of employment that the city provides. It is within this new set of urgencies that the ‘Smart City’ and the urban paradigm of ‘connections and flows’ have emerged as the de-facto approaches to the design of the city.<br><br>We seek to challenge the assumptions of these approaches. The implementation of the Smart City is not limited by a lack of technical innovations, but in the social ramifications of a corporate controlled monitoring apparatus with little democratic oversight. While the paradigm of ‘connections and flows’ promises to satisfy the constantly changing needs of businesses with exible and adaptable spaces, privileging movement over the needs of occupation. This paradigm is embodied by the multi-storey office tower, and the popularity of the multi-function ‘hybrid buildings’ that has seen dispersal of the public realm into all levels of the city. This project proposes to reverse this tendency and reassert the street as the plane of public activity as a deliberate strategy to realize the ambitions of Hiedanranta.<br><br>Though Hiedanranta is situated in picturesque surroundings, it would be a mistake to simply create a waterfront housing district so typical of Finland, as dispersed residential blocks with views and green paths o er only limited possibilities for the city. To create the environmentally conscious district of the future is to acknowledge the possibility of life without a private car. ‘Walkability’ is not simply a matter of scale or the arrangement of transportation nodes, but in providing the level of activity needed within walking distance. Walkability at the scale of the city does not only mean aimless recreation, but in providing the possibility for places and services to walk to. It is with this ambition that this project proposes to prioritize the creation of a dense and high intensity public street to provide the connected and exible spaces that allow activity to flourish.<br><br>The concentration of public activity to the street level offers an organization clarity between the public and private levels of the city. From a practical standpoint, this shift allows for elevated private communal courtyards and terraces while also o ering new potential for the composition of towers and blocks. Perhaps most importantly for the future, this hierarchy o ers a new framework through which to reconsider the smart city. e monitored and connected realm of the public is divided in a very tangible way from the elevated realm of the private. is hierarchy o ers new regulatory possibilities to the implementation of monitoring and data collection, preserving a realm of the private (where these technologies are not implemented by the public sector, but a consumer choice) and a realm of the public that leverages the productive possibilities that these new technologies o er for working.6 is project aims to create a Hiedanranta that privileges not just movement, but occupation as well; a place to live and work.</p><p class="project-img"><img src="/images/turvaverkosto/turvaverkosto_map.jpg" alt="axo-image" width="400"></p><p class="project-img"><img src="/images/turvaverkosto/turvaverkosto_plan.jpg" alt="axo-image" width="400"></p><p class="project-img"><img src="/images/turvaverkosto/turvaverkosto_collage.jpg" alt="axo-image" width="400"></p><p></p></div></section></div><footer><h4 class="home-link"><a href="../index.html">HOME</a></h4></footer><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
