As the metropolitan area grows, it expands outwards into the urban periphery forming conurbations of increasing scale.1 Consequently, models of inner city living are often replicated to densify the urban periphery, displacing its suburban predecessors. While the celebration of urban life—densification, active street fronts and vibrant public spaces, has continued unabated for the past two decades, we should recognize that continued urban expansion is not a process without cost. As the metropolitan area expands, the infrastructure of care and support for the city itself also continues to be pushed into the margins. From big box hardware and grocery stores, to factories, farms and greenhouses, the very material supports for the city itself are often overlooked in the name of supplying the demands of housing and urban development.<br><br>As Vienna’s continued growth expands into its urban periphery, we should consider alternatives to the rote replication of inner city models of living. The project site, Am Heidjöchl, puts into focus the meeting of Vienna’s continued urban expansion and the Marchfeld—Austria’s agricultural heartland. This project, Feldstadt, puts forward an idea for the densification of the periphery by establishing a model through which agriculture continues to be embedded into the built environment. Alternating between dense urban configurations and linear field systems aligned along a north-south axis, the ‘Field block’ is proposed as an urban typology that integrates both agricultural production and urban living by minimizing shading caused by built up volumes. Feldstadt revisits the premise of the garden city, providing generous housing with access to nature, while interrogating the life it promises. By addressing the demands for sustainable models of transportation and the need for walkable streets and light modes of transportation, the vastness of the green landscape is reinterpreted as potential for vibrant and diverse living experiences. In contrast to the repetitive block structures of urban life, the linear stripes create distinctive growing environments that unfold across the site.<br><br>We deploy a specific model of agricultural practice: Agroforestry, premised on the (re)integration of trees and shrubs within arable or pasture based farming. This mixed approach enhances soil health, biodiversity, and the efficiency of water management. Due to policy frameworks with sharp distinctions between arable land, grassland and forest, agroforestry has seen limited use in Austria, but we see its potential as a novel and highly productive addition to existing agricultural practices that can be embedded in models of urban development. In doing so, we hope to serve both the immediate needs of future residents, providing affordable housing and locally produced food, but also to further more intangible outcomes through synergy with education and engagement with agroecological practices as the basis for a sustainable and socially just future.<br><br>Feldstadt is proposed as a counterpart to the informal models of urban farming such as allotment gardens, planting boxes or rooftop farming, recognizing the demands of labor and care at the scale of the city, and the need to foster and defend them. In the seminal text “Wages Against Housework,” Silvia Federici draws parallels between the struggle for the unwaged labor of housework, and the struggle for social services.3 This project aims to formalize and render visible the ‘labor of love’ that exists in farming practices in Vienna, and to adopt a political perspective towards the care of the city from the periphery as the demand by which “our nature ends and our struggle begins.”<br><br></p><p class="project-img"><img src="/images/utmark/utmark_diagram.jpg" alt="axo-image"></p><p class="project-img"><img src="/images/utmark/utmark_axo.jpg" alt="axo-image" width="400"></p><p class="project-img"><img src="/images/utmark/utmark_perspective.jpg" alt="axo-image" width="400"></p><p class="project-img"><img src="/images/utmark/utmark_perspective2.jpg" alt="axo-image" width="400"></p><p></p></div></section></div><footer><h4 class="home-link"><a href="../index.html">HOME</a></h4></footer><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
